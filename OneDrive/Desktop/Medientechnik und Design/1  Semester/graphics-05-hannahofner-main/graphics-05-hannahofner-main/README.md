#### Notes:

_If you have any remarks about your submission (e.g., you couldn't complete all tasks, you had troubles with a particular task...), please let your tutor know by adding a comment here or in the code._


#### Setup:
Make sure that the Python script files (`.py`) and the Blender files (`.blend`) are in the same directory as the `bipr.py` file. You cannot copy the files somewhere else!

The Python scripts are tested with a very recent Blender version (3.4 as of December 2022). If you have another version, you might need to download and install a suitable version from [here](https://download.blender.org/release/Blender3.4/). You can check the version in the Blender splash screen.
